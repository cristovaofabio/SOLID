# SOLID ðŸ’»

This project was created only to practice the SOLID principles!

### Single Responsibility
* A class should have a single responsibility.
### Open/Closed
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov Substitution
* A derived class must be replaceable with its base class.
### Interface Segregation
* Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use
### Dependency Inversion
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.

## Features :pushpin:
* Add and remove product to shopping cart;
* Calculate the total value and the discount;
* Show message to client;
